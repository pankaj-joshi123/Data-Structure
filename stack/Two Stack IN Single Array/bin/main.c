in the Geeks for geeks method he has given if closing types of brackets apperars then pop the previous....if the popped element appears then
it is okay if they are different
then that means they are not balanced



********

i have my approach also that i scan the full string and pop two times one at top and one at the bottom at any moment if they are not equal
then it shows that they are not balanced

but this is more time consuming also more operations are required to it
